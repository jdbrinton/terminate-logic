## Instructions

This is an Altium Designer project. If you don't have Altium all the files you need for fabrication and assembly are in the .zip file. The included [terminate-logic.pdf](terminate-logic.pdf) contains fabrication and assembly instructions.

## Disclaimers

I have not yet assembled or tested this, so fly at your own risk!
